## Installation

```
npm i @ngneat/falso
yarn add @ngneat/falso
```

### Usage

```ts
import { randEmail, randFullName } from '@ngneat/falso';

const user = { email: randEmail(), name: randFullName() };

const emails = randEmail({ length: 10 });
```

You can specify the length of elements you want to generate. Below is an example of generating 10 emails with length equal or smaller than 20 characters.

```ts
const emails = randEmail({ length: 10, maxCharCount: 20 });
```

### Setting a Randomness Seed

You can set your own seed if you want consistent results:

```ts
import { rand, seed } from '@ngneat/falso';

seed('some-constant-seed');

// Always returns 2
rand([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Reset random seed
seed();
```
